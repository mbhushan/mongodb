Mongo Notes
===============
The fact remains that data is relational, and MongoDB doesn’t support joins.

MongoDB supports arrays as first class objects of a document. This is  
when dealing with many-to-one or many-to-many relationships.
arrays of values are much more convenient to deal with than many-to-many join-tables.

embedded documents can be queried using a dot-notation:
we can even embed arrays of documents: db.employees.insert({_id: ObjectId( “4d85c7039ab0fd70a117d73
name: ‘Chani’, family: [ {relation:‘mother’,name: ‘Chani’}, {relation:‘father’,name: ‘Paul’}, {relation:‘brother’, name:
‘Duncan’}]})

Denormalization

Arrays of ids can be a useful strategy when dealing with one-to-many or many-to-many scenarios.
But more commonly, new developers are left deciding between using embedded documents versus doing “manual” referencing.
you should know that an individual document is currently limited to 16 megabytes in size.
MongoDB lets you query and index fields of an embedded documents and arrays.
The only way you can go wrong is by not trying.

Only you know whether the benefits of introducing a new solution outweigh the costs.

CHAPTER-5 When to use MongoDB
==============================

An oft-touted benefit of document-oriented database is that they don’t enforce a fixed schema.
Serialize it to JSON (technically BSON, but close enough) and send it to MongoDB. There is no property mapping or type mapping. 
This straightforwardness definitely flows to you, the end developer.

One area where MongoDB can fit a specialized role is in logging. There are two aspects of MongoDB which make writes
quite fast. First, you have an option to send a write command and have it return immediately without waiting for the
write to be acknowledged. Secondly, you can control the write behavior with respect to data durability.

CAPPED COLLECTION:
//limit our capped collection to 1 megabyte
db.createCollection('logs', {capped: true , size: 1048576})

If you want to “expire” your data based on time rather than overall collection size, you can use TTL Indexes where TTL
stands for “time-to-live”.


CHAPTER-6 AGGREGATION
============================
Aggregation pipeline gives you a way to transform and combine documents in your collection
db.unicorns.aggregate([{$group:{_id:'$gender', total: {$sum:1}}}])

$sort and $limit in combination allow you to get answers to “top N” types of questions.

CHAPTER-7 Performance and Tools
====================================
Indexes: they help improve query and sorting performance. Indexes are created via ensureIndex
db.unicorns.ensureIndex({name: 1});
## And dropped via dropIndex :
db.unicorns.dropIndex({name: 1});
db.unicorns.ensureIndex({name: 1}, {unique: true });
Indexes can be created on embedded fields (again, using the dot-notation) and on array fields. We can also create
compound indexes:
